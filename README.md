## Hi, I’m Jack | [YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/@jack-coding/)
I'm an independent developer from Devon in the South West of England, running off mostly self taught coding skills and very stuck in tutorial hell.
My current skillset is one of mostly Python, specialising in [PyGame](https://pyga.me/) to make simple 2D "games"
though I plan to eventually try to learn something better suited for game development and some actual game theory
